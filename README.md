# CSSconf Nordic

Inspired by the [Web Rebels organizer wiki](https://github.com/webrebels/rebeladmin/wiki), let’s try to collect some information on how we are making this conference happen. This can make it easier for us to find information — and there is a lot we can and should be transparent about.

## 2016

* When: Wednesday 01 June 2016
* Where: Oslo, Norway
* Venue: [Dansens hus](http://www.dansenshus.com/)

## Part of the international CSSconf family

We are part of a series of events around the world. We are commited to diversity and operate under a [Code of Conduct](http://cssconf.no/#CoC). More on [cssconf.org](http://cssconf.org/) about what it means to organize a CSSconf.

## Happening same week at same venue

These three conferences are separate conferences, but some things are co-ordinated between the events.
