# CSSconf Nordic

Inspired by the [Web Rebels organizer wiki](https://github.com/webrebels/rebeladmin/wiki), let’s try to collect some information on how we are making this conference happen. This can make it easier for us to find information — and there is a lot we want to be transparent about.

## Speakers
Our talk selection process includes a Call for Speakers (CfS) in combination with some speakers being invited directly. We are inspired by CSSconf EU’s [strategies to make biases conscious](http://blog.cssconf.eu/2015/08/15/a-talk-selection-process-explained/).
