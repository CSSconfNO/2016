# CSSconf Nordic

Inspired by the [Web Rebels organizer wiki](https://github.com/webrebels/rebeladmin/wiki), let’s try to collect some information on how we are making this conference happen. This can make it easier for us to find information — and there is a lot we want to be transparent about.

## Part of the international CSSconf family

We are part of a series of events around the world. We are commited to diversity and operate under a [Code of Conduct](http://cssconf.no/#CoC). More on [cssconf.org](http://cssconf.org/) about what it means to organize a CSSconf.

## Collaborations
The first week of June 2016, there are 3 conferences happening in Oslo: CSSconf, Web Rebels and NodeConf. More about the background in this post about [Web Rebels’ 5th Anniversary Edition](http://webrebels.tumblr.com/post/135241817448/anniversary-edition). These are separate conferences, but some things are co-ordinated between the events. This includes for example venue booking, accounting, possibly ticket sales and  probably [scholarships](http://webrebels.tumblr.com/post/132863505363/how-we-started-the-web-rebels-scholarship).
