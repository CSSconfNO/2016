<h2>Travel to and from the airport</h2>

<p>If you are flying into Oslo you will arrive at and depart from Oslo Airport Gardermoen (OSL). Between the airport and Oslo Central Station (nicknamed Oslo S) there is a high speed airport express, named Flytoget, running every 10 minutes. The travel time is ~20 minutes. Departures can be checked here.</p>

<p>If you did not receive airport express tickets before departure, please purchase one (ticket machines take credit cards) and give it to Elisabeth at any time during the conference. We will refund it in cash, and give you a ticket for the return.</p>

<p>If your travel is delayed or if you have any problems during your travel, please let us know so we can help.</p>

<h2>The hotel</h2>

<p>Your room is booked in your name at Scandic Vulcan.<br>
Address: Maridalsveien 13 A, 0175 Oslo<br>
Phone: +47 21 05 71 00</p>

<h2>Getting to the hotel</h2>

<p>It is possible to walk to the hotel from Oslo Central Station. It is about a 20 minute walk. This is the best and fastest walking route.</p>

<p>The best way to get to the hotel is by tram and then a small walk. From Oslo Central Station you can take tram 11, 12 and 13 eastbound to Schous Plass (four stops from Oslo Central Station). At Schous Plass you can walk this short route to the hotel.</p>

<h2>Getting around in Oslo</h2>

<p>Most of you will have received a public transport pass before you depart for Oslo. If you have not received one before departure, you will get one from Elisabeth when you arrive.</p>

<p>The public transport pass is valid for 7 days from the day it's first validated. It is valid for all public busses, trams, subways and boats to the islands in the Oslo fjord and some local trains. You should validate the card each time you use the public transport system. You can validate the card on board busses, trams and boats. On subways and trains you need to validate the card before entering.</p>

<p>Timetables, network maps and all other information you should need about public transport in Oslo can be found here.</p>

<h2>Speaker dinner</h2>

<p>At 18:00 on Wednesday 1st June there will be a speaker dinner. Organizers will be in the lobby of the hotel at 17:45 until 18:00 so you can join us there.</p>

<p>If you have a special diet (vegan, vegeterian, allergies, etc.) pleace let us know in advance and we will arrange food which suits your diet.</p>

<h2>The venue</h2>

<p>The venue is a dance performance venue named Dansens Hus and is ~30 meters from the conference hotel.</p>

<p>At the there will be a section of medium sized tables up front and chairs in an audiotorium setting behind that. The speaker will be at the same level as the ground floor. There is no dedicated speaker area at the venue. For the speaker there will be a small round table in standing hight and access to fresh drinking water.</p>

<h2>Technical</h2>

<p>The projector is a full HD 1080P projector with a 1920x1080 resolution. On stage there will be HDMI and VGA cable to connect to the projector. If your laptop needs a bridge to connect to HDMI or VGA, please bring one.</p>

<p>There will be a sound engineer controlling all sound from the stage and you will be given a small wireless headset microphone so your hands are free. If your presentation requires sound, please let us know before the conference starts so a cable to connect to the PA can be provided for you.</p>

<p>On stage there is also a dedicated Internet connection which will not interfere with the connection used by the attendees. This connection can be used if you need a guaranteed connection to Internet.</p>

<p>Norway use Type F power outlets. If your laptop has another type, please bring a converter.</p>

<h2>Your talk</h2>

<p>Please make yourself familiar with the schedule and the time for your talk. Please be by the stage about 15 minutes before it is your turn to enter the stage. There is a longer break after every second talk. Your speaker slot is 30 to 35 minutes.</p>

<p>We have a dedicated MC. We encourage attendees to ask questions on Twitter during each talk. Based on these questions and MC's super powers of knowledge, you and the MC will have a QA session about your talk. The QA session will be held in a seated area on stage and will last between 5 and 10 minutes. In other words there will not be any direct questions from the audience. </p>

<p>The MC for CSSconf Nordic is Jenn Schiffer.</p>

<h2>Filming and streaming</h2>

<p>Your talk will be professionally filmed and published after the conference under a CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 licence. We will also stream all talks live in full HD. Information about that the conference will be streamed will be published the day before the conference.</p>

<p>If you are anything but thrilled about your talk being filmed, published and/or streamed ‚Äî talk to us about it, and we will be happy to work out something that you are happy with.</p>
