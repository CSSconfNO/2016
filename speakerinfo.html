<h2>The hotel</h2>

<p>
Name: <a href="https://www.scandichotels.com/hotels/norway/oslo/scandic-vulkan">Scandic Vulcan</a><br>
Address: Maridalsveien 13 A, 0175 Oslo<br>
Phone: +47 21 05 71 00</p>

<p>The room is booked in your name, and breakfast is included. The building right next door has a grocery store: 
<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Kt4M3dp49mS2">directions to Rema 1000</a>.</p>

<h2>Travel to and from the airport</h2>

<p>Flights all arrive at <a href="https://avinor.no/en/airport/oslo-airport/">Oslo Airport Gardermoen (OSL)</a>. Take the Airport Express (Flytoget) to Oslo Central Station (Oslo S). Departures every 10&nbsp;minutes. The travel time is ~20 minutes.</p>

<p>If you didn‚Äôt receive your airport express tickets in the post before departure, please purchase one (ticket machines take credit cards) and give it to Elisabeth at any time during the conference. We will refund it in cash, and give you a ticket for the return.</p>

<p>If your travel is delayed, or if you have any problems, please let us know so we can help.</p>

<h2>Getting around in Oslo</h2>

<p>We recommend using the public transport system. üöå üëç If you didn‚Äôt receive your card in the post before departure, let us know and we will get you a replacement after you arrive at the hotel.</p>

<h3>Remember to validate the public transport card</h3>
<p>The card is valid for 7 days from the time it‚Äôs first validated by being swiped. You can use it on buses, trams, subways, boats to the islands in the Oslo fjord and some local trains. Ticket controls are frequent, so please make sure you always travel with a valid ticket. Validate the card each time: by swiping on board buses, trams and boats ‚Äî or before entering the station areas of subways and trains.</p>

<h2>Getting to the hotel</h2>

<p>The best way to get to the hotel is by tram and then a small walk.</p>

<p><strong>12&nbsp;Disen</strong> or <strong>13&nbsp;Storo-Grefsen</strong> 
are blue trams, that you find right outside the central station. 3&nbsp;stops (6&nbsp;min)
and get off at Schous plass. Then follow <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/k7GpPsWjkyN2">this short route to the hotel</a>.</p>

<p><strong>54&nbsp;Kjels√•s</strong> is a red bus, that you can also take from right outside the station. 4&nbsp;stops (7&nbsp;min) and get off at Telthusbakken.</p>

<p>You can also walk from the station to the hotel in about 20&nbsp;minutes: <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/KGEBq">the&nbsp;fastest walking route</a>.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Your talk</h2>

<p>We wanted an easy-going schedule that doesn't need to rush any of us. People get time to talk to fellow attendees, and we all avoid the stress of a tight schedule.</p>

<ul>
  <li>4 sessions with 2 speakers (45&nbsp;+&nbsp;45 minutes)</li>
  <li>30 min talk / 15 min for chat in the couch, messages ++</li>
</ul>

<p>Please show up by the stage 15 minutes before your talk.</p>

<p>Talk length: aim for 30 minutes ‚Äî but don‚Äôt worry too much about going over on time. We have the 15 min buffer in the schedule.</p>

<h3>Chat in the couch</h3>

<p>After your talk, you will step over to the couch for a friendly chat with our awesome master of ceremonies: <a href="http://twitter.com/jennschiffer">Jenn Schiffer</a>.</p>

<p>Q&As can often be a drag, but we believe they can be positive when done right. Previous years of Web Rebels, this has worked really well, giving some ebb and flow to the day. Nothing directly from the audience, Jenn will curate any questions and you can talk to us upfront about any concerns or requests you have. It‚Äôs meant to be a relaxed chat ‚Äî not an interrogation! If anyone prefers to not do anything after their talk, let us know and we will work that out.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<p>When you‚Äôre working on talks and slides, we appreciate that you keep in mind that the conference has a <a href="http://confcodeofconduct.com/">Code of Conduct</a>. Please make yourself familiar with it, and if you have any questions, we are here to help!</p>

<p>If anything happens during the week that we as organizers should be made aware of, we very much appreciate that you tell us.</p>

<hr>

<h2>The venue</h2>

<p>The venue is a dance performance venue named Dansens Hus and is ~30&nbsp;meters from the conference hotel.</p>

<p>Our audience will be sitting in a section of medium sized tables up front, with more seating in an auditorium behind that. Speakers will be standing at the same level as the ground floor, so there is no elevated stage. For your talk, there will be a small round table in standing height and access to fresh drinking water.</p>

<p>We can‚Äôt offer a dedicated speaker area at the venue, but we‚Äôll have a reserved table for you to sit up front. The caf√© <a href="http://www.vulkanoslo.no/en/business/hendrix-ibsen/">Hendrix Ibsen</a> right next to the venue has excellent coffee, free wifi and power outlets.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Technical</h2>

<p>The projector is a full HD 1080P projector with a 1920x1080 resolution. There will be HDMI and VGA cable to connect to the projector. If your laptop needs a bridge to connect to HDMI or VGA, please bring one.</p>

<p>A sound engineer will be controlling all sound from the stage and you will be given a small wireless headset microphone so your hands are free. If your presentation requires sound, please let us know in advance, so a cable to connect to the PA can be provided for you.</p>

<p>Need a guaranteed connection to the Internet during your talk? We have a dedicated connection that will not be shared with attendees.</p>

<p>Norway use <a href="http://www.world-power-plug.com/power-plug/Norway">Type F power outlets</a>. If your laptop has another type, please remember to bring a converter.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Filming and streaming</h2>

<p>Your talk will be professionally filmed and published after the conference under a CC BY-NC-SA 3.0 licence. We will also stream all talks live in full HD. Information that the conference will be streamed will be published the day before the conference.</p>

<p>If you are anything but thrilled about your talk being filmed, published and/or streamed ‚Äî talk to us about it, and we will be happy to work out something that you are happy with.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Transparency</h2>

<h3>Talk selection</h3>
<p>Most of you submitted to our Call for Speakers and were selected in that talk selection process. Some were invited directly. This is not something we are using to differentiate, or make futher mention about from our side. But you can of course feel free to talk about how you ended up in the lineup any way you want.</p>

<h3>Travel and accomodation</h3>
<p>The conference has covered speakers‚Äô travel to Oslo, except for one who‚Äôs employer has paid for their flight. All visitors were invited to stay at the hotel for at least up to 5 nights. With various travel wishes your bookings vary from 3 to 6 nights, and with a double room for those travelling with someone else. The expences per speaker are not identical, but we have done our best to be fair.</p>

<h3>Food and drinks</h3>
<p>Breakfast buffet is included at your hotel. Lunch during all conference days is covered by a prepaid card at Mathallen. The speakers‚Äô dinner on Wednesday will be paid for by Web Rebels. We may occasionally be able to pick up the tab for you as our guests at other times. But we don‚Äôt have the budget to treat you unlimited during your visit in Oslo, so we do also need you to pay some food and drinks yourself.</p>

<h3>Other money issues</h3>
<p>Speaking at CSSconf Nordic is an unpaid volunteer gig for all speakers. The event is also organized entirely by unpaid volunteers. After the conference is over, we will be publishing a transparency report.</p>

<h2>Questions or thoughts?</h2>
<p>Don‚Äôt hesitate to bring up anything on your mind. We are here to help!</p>

<p>All the best,<br>
Ida and Elisabeth.</p>
