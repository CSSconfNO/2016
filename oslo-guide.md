# Oslo Guide

The conference venue at Vulkan is in walking distance from our favourite parts of Oslo: Grünerløkka and Torggata. Here are some suggestions in these 3 areas, but you will also find lots more in the same neighbourhoods. Also: sights in other parts of the city!

## Vulkan
* **Hendrix Ibsen** — Coffee, wifi, power outlets, snacks.
* **Døgnvill Burger** — Speciality burgers and scrumptious milkshakes.
* **Mathallen** — Indoor food market with shops, cafés and eateries, for example:
* **Smelteverket** — Gastropub in the basement.
* **Solberg & Hansen** — Excellent coffee and tea.
* **Hopyard** — Impressive selection of bottled beer.
* **Paradis Gelateria** — Mmm, ice cream…

## Grünerløkka
* **Villa Paradiso** — Pizza! A great affordable dinner option.
* **Tim Wendelboe** — A must for coffee geeks.
* **BrewDog BD57** — A must for craft beer geeks.
* **Kamai Café** — Treat yourself to yummy sushi and bao.
* **Territoriet** — An excellent choice for wine. And cheese.
* **Chillout** — Travel shop and café with affordable lunch.
* **Grünerløkka Brygghus** — Local brew pub with food.

## Torggata
* **Café Sara** — Affordable food and excellent beer selection.
* **Peloton** — Perfect spot to work and/or grab a pizza.
* **Fiskeriet Youngstorget** — Great seafood at informal place.
* **Tilt** — Shuffleboard, pinball and lots of great beers.
* **Crowbar** — Brewpub with local and guest brews on tap.
* **Freddy Fuego Burrito Bar** — Mmmm, affordable burritos!
* **Taco República** — Mmmmm, top notch tasty tacos!

## Sights
* **Frogner Park** — Lovely park (free!) full of fun statues to photograph and attribute false quotes about CSS.
* **Karl Johans gate** — Main street (free if you just walk!) from the central station, pass the Norwegian Parliament and National Theatre, and end up at the Royal Palace.
* **Opera House** — Awesome architecture to walk across (free!), right next to the central station.
* **The Munch Museum** — Go check out The Scream and other paintings (NOK 100). Natural History Museum (NOK 50) and Botanical Garden (free!) are in the same area.
* **Astrup Fearnley** — Art gallery (NOK 120) at Tjuvholmen, fancy part of the city that can be an interesting stroll.
* **Walk up to St. Hanshaugen** — Follow Telthusbakken, Old Aker Church and 
cemetery, past the Synagogue in Bergstien and up to the park.
* **Government Quarter** — Not usually listed as a tourist attraction, these buildings are the first site of the 2011 terror attacks. We think it’s important that visitors come here. And when you go back home, remind others about this right-wing Christian terrorist with a xenophobic worldview. Don’t miss the unrepaired newspaper display case, and Y-block with outside relief after drawings by Pablo Picasso.

## Practical tips and getting around

We recommend using [public transport](https://ruter.no/en/getting-help/travelling-on-public-transport/). Ticket inspections are frequent, so please make sure you always travel with a valid ticket.

The best way to get to the venue is by tram and then a small walk. 12 Disen or 13 Storo-Grefsen are blue trams, that you find right outside the central station. 3 stops (6 min) and get off at Schous plass.

If you arrive at [Oslo Airport Gardermoen (OSL)](https://avinor.no/en/airport/oslo-airport/), you can take the [airport express (Flytoget)](http://flytoget.no/flytoget_eng/) which is super convenient. Or you can save some moeny by taking a local train in to Oslo Central Station.

**ATM to withdraw** or **Forex Bank to exchange** can both be found in the same area at the station. Remember: Norwegian Kroners, not Euros! You can use a card almost everywhere, so many locals will not carry cash daily. Visitors may have issues if cards have no chip. But if you have a VISA or MasterCard with a chip, you might not need a lot of cash in Oslo.
