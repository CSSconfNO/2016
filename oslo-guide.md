# Oslo Guide

The conference venue at [Vulkan](#vulkan) is in walking distance from our favourite parts of Oslo: [Gr√ºnerl√∏kka](#gr%C3%BCnerl%C3%B8kka) and [Torggata](#torggata). Here are some suggestions, but you will also find lots more in the same neighbourhoods.

## Places to walk and things to do
* **[Frogner Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogner_Park)** ‚Äî Lovely park (free!) full of fun statues to photograph and attribute false quotes about CSS.
* **[Karl Johans gate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Johans_gate)** ‚Äî Main street (free if you just walk!) from the central station, pass the Norwegian Parliament and National Theatre, and end up at the Royal Palace.
* **[Opera House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Opera_House)** ‚Äî Awesome architecture to walk across (free!), right next to the central station.
* **[The Munch Museum](http://munchmuseet.no/en/visit)** ‚Äî Go check out The Scream and other paintings (NOK 100). [Natural History Museum](http://www.nhm.uio.no/english/) (NOK 50) and [Botanical Garden](http://www.nhm.uio.no/english/visiting/botanical-garden/) (free!) are in the same area.
* **[Astrup Fearnley](http://afmuseet.no/en/hjem)** ‚Äî Art gallery (NOK 120) at [Tjuvholmen](http://www.visitoslo.com/en/product/?TLp=554819), fancy part of the city that can be an interesting stroll. Bus 54 goes straight from Vulkan out here.
* **Walk up to St. Hanshaugen** ‚Äî Follow [Telthusbakken](http://www.visitoslo.com/en/product/?TLp=181574), [Old Aker Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Aker_Church) and 
cemetery, past the [Synagogue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Synagogue) in Bergstien and up to the park.
* **[Government Quarter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regjeringskvartalet)** ‚Äî Not usually listed as a tourist attraction, these buildings are the first site of the [2011 terror attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_Norway_attacks). We think it‚Äôs important that visitors come here. And when you go back home, remind others about this right-wing Christian terrorist with a xenophobic worldview. Don‚Äôt miss the unrepaired newspaper display case, and Y-block with [mural by Pablo Picasso](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso's_Regjeringskvartalet_murals).

## Practical tips and getting around

We recommend using [public transport](https://ruter.no/en/getting-help/travelling-on-public-transport/). üöåüëç Ticket inspections are frequent, so please make sure you always travel with a valid ticket. The best way to get to the venue is by tram and then a small walk. 12 Disen or 13 Storo-Grefsen are blue trams, that you find right outside the central station. 3 stops (6 min) and get off at [Schous plass and walk 500m](https://goo.gl/maps/k7GpPsWjkyN2).

If you arrive at [Oslo Airport Gardermoen (OSL)](https://avinor.no/en/airport/oslo-airport/), you can take the [airport express (Flytoget)](http://flytoget.no/flytoget_eng/) which is super convenient. Or you can save some money by taking a local train in to Oslo Central Station.

üí∞ **ATM to withdraw** or **Forex Bank to exchange** can both be found in the same area at the station. Remember: Norwegian Kroners, not Euros! You can use a card almost everywhere, so many locals will not carry cash daily. Visitors may have issues if cards have no chip. But if you have a VISA or MasterCard with a chip, you might not need a lot of cash in Oslo.
