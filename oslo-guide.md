# Oslo Guide

The conference venue at Vulkan is in walking distance from our favourite parts of Oslo: Grünerløkka and Torggata. Here are some suggestions in these 3 areas, but you will also find lots more in the same neighbourhoods. Also: sights in other parts of the city!

## Vulkan
**Hendrix Ibsen** — Coffee, wifi, power outlets, snacks.

**Mathallen** — Indoor food market with shops, cafés and eateries, for example:
**Smelteverket** — Gastropub in the basement.
**Solberg & Hansen** — Excellent coffee and tea.
**Hopyard** — Impressive selection of bottled beer.
**Paradis Gelateria** — Mmm, ice cream…

## Grünerløkka
**Villa Paradiso** — Pizza! A great affordable dinner option.
**Tim Wendelboe** — A must for coffee geeks.
**BrewDog BD57** — A must for craft beer geeks.
**Kamai Café** — Treat yourself to yummy sushi and bao.

**Taco República** — Mmmmm, top notch tasty tacos!

## Sights
**Frogner Park** — Lovely park (free!) full of fun statues to photograph and attribute false quotes about CSS.
**Karl Johans gate** — Main street (free if you just walk!) from the central station, pass the Norwegian Parliament and National Theatre, and end up at the Royal Palace.
**Opera House** — Awesome architecture to walk across (free!), right next to the central station.
**The Munch Museum** — Go check out The Scream and other paintings (NOK 100). Natural History Museum (NOK 50) and Botanical Garden (free!) are in the same area.
**Astrup Fearnley** — Art gallery (NOK 120) at Tjuvholmen, fancy part of the city that can be an interesting stroll.
**Walk up to St. Hanshaugen** — Follow Telthusbakken, Old Aker Church and 
cemetery, past the Synagogue in Bergstien and up to the park.
**Government Quarter** — Not usually listed as a tourist attraction, these buildings are the first site of the 2011 terror attacks. We think it’s important that visitors come here. And when you go back home, remind others about this right-wing Christian terrorist with a xenophobic worldview. Don’t miss the unrepaired newspaper display case, and Y-block with outside relief after drawings by Pablo Picasso.
