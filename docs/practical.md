# Practical info
A collection of practical info for CSSconf attendees.

## An international CSSconf family
Since the prototype, CSSconf US, was started by Nicole Sullivan in 2013, the CSSconf family has expanded around the globe. All CSSconf organizer teams share the vision of an international, diverse and creative CSS community, for which the CSSconf series offers a platform to meet, hack, share knowledge and build friendships.

## Community conference
CSSconf Nordic is a not-for-profit community conference. Thanks to our sponsors: Mozilla, Opbeat and GitHub.

## Code of Conduct
All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers are required to agree with the [Code of Conduct](http://confcodeofconduct.com/). You can find the link in the footer of [cssconf.no](http://cssconf.no/). This is the same code that is used at a lot of other community conferences. We expect cooperation from all to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

If anything happens during the week that organizers should be made aware of, we appreciate that you tell us. You can contact any crew member at any time, they can be indentified by their crew T-shirts and marked conf passes. All reports are anonymous.

## No beverages in main room
Bottles of water are ok, but nothing else. This is a dance performance venue with expensive wooden floors, so not wrecking them with liquid spills is a condition for us to be here. Enjoy your coffee, tea, milkshakes, ice cream & everything else out in the sun. And finish them before going back into the venue.

## Toilets
There are toilets in the dark glass box in the lounge area. Follow the red dancing icons! If there is a queue, you can also find more in the basement at Mathallen.

## Lunch
There is a lunch card inside your conf pass! This is a prepaid card with 150 kroners, that you can use anywhere at Mathallen.

## Dinner
No official conference dinner on Wednesday. No budgets for this, so you need to feed yourself. But if you want to find other attendees to grab a some food with, we have some tables reserved at BD57. This is the [Brewdog pub](http://www.bd57.no/) at Markveien 57, just 500 meters away from the venue. Also see other suggestions near by in our [Oslo guide](https://github.com/CSSconfNO/docs/blob/gh-pages/oslo-guide.md).

## Meet & greet at V bar
Social meet and greet for folks from all three events. From 19:00 at V Bar & Bistro, the bar on the ground floor of the Scandic hotel, right next to the venue. No budgets for the Wednesday evening event, you need to pay for your own beverages. Come say hi to fellow attendees from CSSconf, Web Rebels and NodeConf Oslo.
