            <h1>Call for Speakers</h1>

            <ul>
                <li>One day, one track, 8 speakers</li>
                <li>Talk duration: 30â€“40 minutes</li>
                <li>Submit your proposal by <strong>31 January 2016</strong></li>
            </ul>

             <p>This is an invitation for you to submit your ideas for a talk. Our goal for CSSconf Nordic is to organize an inclusive event with a positive vibe. It doesnâ€™t matter if you are a professional with years of experience, or if you just got started. What matters is that you have something to share that you are passionate about.</p>

             <a class="btn" href="#">Take a look at the CfS form <span class="btn-emoji">ðŸ‘‰</span></a>

             <h2>There is so much to talk about</h2>
             <p>We hope submissions will span a wide range of CSS-related topics, and wrote a list of <a href="https://github.com/CSSconfNO/sparks-for-talk-proposals">words to spark your brainstorming</a>. This is a CSS conference, but the day can also be about more than code. Perhaps you have the talk that makes us all think how we can use these skills of ours to make a positive impact in the world.</p>

             <h2>We want a variety of talk styles</h2>
             <ul>
                 <li>Tutorials with techniques we start using the following week</li>
                 <li>Inspirational stories that linger in our minds all year</li>
                 <li>Fundamentals that give us a deeper understanding</li>
                 <li>Balanced perspectives to challenge our own ideas</li>
                 <li>Quirky topics that spark interesting hallway conversations</li>
             </ul>

             <h2>We welcome new speakers</h2>
             <p>If you are worried that you are not experienced enough as a speaker or that your topic is not interesting enough â€” remember that this is not your decision. You are not the one curating a conference program, you just have to submit a proposal. Also note, that you can absolutely <a href="http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/starting-with-nothing.html">Start with Nothing</a>. Go for it!</p>

             <h2>Your proposal</h2>
             <p>Please write a detailed, but brief description of your talk. 100â€“150 words is fine. Recommended reading: Tiffany Conroyâ€™s tips on <a href="http://weareallaweso.me/for_speakers/how-to-write-a-compelling-proposal.html">How to write a compelling proposal</a>.</p>

             <h2>We pay for travel and hotel</h2>
             <p>CSSconf Nordic is a not-for-profit community conference. Speaking at the event is an unpaid volunteer gig, but all your main expences will be covered. If your proposal is selected, this is what you can expect: We pay for your travel to Oslo, and up to 4 nights in a hotel. We will book everything for you (unless you prefer to do so yourself). If you happen to purchase a conference ticket and also submit a proposal that is selected, weâ€™ll happily refund your ticket. We want to make sure your stay is as enjoyable as possible. If you have any concerns or questions about whether your needs can be addressed, please <a href="mailto:hello@cssconf.no">contact us</a>.</p>

             <h2>The selection process</h2>
             <p>We are waiting until after the deadline before we start looking at submissions. We want to give them equal attention, and are also holding an anonymized first review round. Read more about the <a href="https://github.com/CSSconfNO/cssconfno-admin/blob/master/talk-selection.md">talk selection process in our organizer docs</a>.</p>

             <h2>Code of conduct</h2>
             <p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with our <a href="http://cssconf.no/#CoC">Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

             <h2>Questions?</h2>
             <p>If you have questions, please <a href="mailto:hello@cssconf.no">contact us</a>.</p>
